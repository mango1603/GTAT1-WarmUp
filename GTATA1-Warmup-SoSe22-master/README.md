# Introductory assignments for GTATA1 @ HTW Berlin

This project is an introductory assignment to prepare students to use the Unity
engine on their own. It included incomplete games with their basic internals
built from scratch, to give an impression how much (or little) code is required
for basic gameplay interactions.

- Install [Unity 2021.1.16f1][2] (see fig 1), [Download Archive][3]
